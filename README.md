PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Whenever someone has to travel using the public transport which is bus they always see the available options and seek help with their boarding point and the destination point. The optimal path where the time required to reach the destination is the minimum. if there is no direct bus from the boarding point to the destination point then the preffered path that is to be taken for the optimal time andd last but not the least the Estimated time of arrival.


We have genrated a AI model which takes the insights and then provide us with the Solutions for the problem statement stated above.


Smart BUS AI

The Smart Bus AI project is an innovative system designed to streamline bus transportation by leveraging artificial intelligence technology. Here's a detailed description of its functionalities:

1.Bus Timings Data Fetching: The AI component of the system gathers real-time or pre-updated data on bus timings from relevant sources, such as transit authorities or databases. This ensures that the information provided to users is accurate and up-to-date.

2.Shortest Route Calculation using A Algorithm*: Once the user inputs their starting point and destination, the AI employs the A* algorithm to determine the shortest and most efficient route between the two locations. A* is a widely used pathfinding algorithm known for its effectiveness in finding the optimal path in a graph by considering both the cost of reaching a node and the estimated cost to the goal.

3.Estimated Duration of the Tour: After computing the shortest route, the system calculates the estimated duration of the entire bus tour. This includes the time required for traveling between stops, waiting for transfers if applicable, and any other factors influencing the journey's duration.

4.User Interaction: The system prompts the user to input their starting point and destination through a user-friendly interface, which could be a mobile app, website, or any other accessible platform. Users can provide this information either by typing in the locations or selecting them from a list.

5.Feedback and Adjustment: Additionally, the Smart Bus AI system may offer users the option to provide feedback on the suggested route or estimated duration. This feedback mechanism allows the system to continuously improve its recommendations based on user preferences and real-world conditions.

Overall, the Smart Bus AI project aims to enhance the public transportation experience by providing users with accurate bus timings, optimal routes, and estimated travel durations, thereby improving efficiency and convenience for commuters.
